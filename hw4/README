Homework 4:Projections

### Compile and execute
$ make
$ ./hw4
Then the window opens up and shows the 3D scene with multiple cacti, bush trees, a sun, a car, and a pine tree.Then the window opens up and shows the 3D scene with multiple cacti, bush trees, a sun, a car, and a pine tree. Includes first person navigation, orthagonal, and perspective view.

#### Commands to interact with the program: 
*  0      Reset view angle to 0,0,0 and mode to orthagonal projection (mode 0)
 *  1      Switch to perspective projection (mode 1)
 *  2       Switch to first person view (mode 0)
 *  m changes the mode from orthagonal (0) to perspective (1) to first person (3) projection
 * * In all modes (0,1,2):
 *     +/-   Change field of view for perspective
 *     - x/X looks down the x axis
 *     - y/Y looks down the y axis
 *     - z/Z looks down the z axis
 *     - Left/right arrows rotate about the y axis
 *    -  Up/down arrows rotate about the x axis
 * 
 * In first person (2) mode only:
 *     - f moves forward
 *     - b moves backward
 * ESC closes the window and terminates the program

- This is an iteration of hw3 with added projection modes
- As usual borrows heavily from in class examples and especially ex8 and ex9
- Office hours were also incredibly helpful

- This assignment took me 23 hours
