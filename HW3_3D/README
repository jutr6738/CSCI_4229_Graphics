Homework 3:3D Modeling

### Compile and execute
$ make
$ ./hw3
Then the window opens up and shows the 3D scene with multiple cacti, bush trees, a sun, a car, and a pine tree.

#### Commands to interact with the program: 
- arrows Change view angle (left/right arrows rotates about the y axis up/down arrows rotates about the x axis)
- 0      Reset view angle to 0,0,0 
- m changes the mode from orthagonal to perspective projection
- ESC closes the window and terminates the program

* I worked on my original submission for well over 25 hours and then this new version for 15 hours over the weekend.
* I was unable to make the corrections that were commented on my submission. I was super frusturated with rewriting my room scene and I realized how unscalable it was becasue I had hard coded all of the vertices. As a result I completely scratched that scene and restarted with something that I will like to eventually turn into a mario cart type game. I plan to iterate on this for future assignments
* Borrows heavily ex8 and basic shape drawing functions from my previous attempt
* This site helped me significantly https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter02.html
* I also used http://www.rgbtool.com/ for choosing colors
